# saj_backup

## Requirements:
- WinRAR Premium (for Resources Backup)

## Description:
saj_backup is a set of .bat files designed to automate the backup of your SQL databases, resource folders, and other critical data. These scripts are not FiveM-specific but are intended to be used for general backup purposes.

## Features:
- Automated Backups: The .bat files allow you to back up your SQL databases and resource folders efficiently.
- Organized Storage: Backups are saved in subfolders within a main "Backup" directory. This directory can be synchronized with cloud storage services like Mega.nz for secure offsite storage.

## Setup Instructions:
- Resource Folder Backup:
Edit the .bat file to specify the directory of the folder you wish to back up and the destination for the resulting .zip file.
- SQL Database Backup:
Update the .bat file with the name of your SQL database.

## Automating Backups:
To schedule automatic backups at specific dates, times, or intervals, refer to this [Task Scheduler](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-automated-task-using-task-scheduler-windows-10) tutorial.
